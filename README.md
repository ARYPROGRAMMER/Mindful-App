## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
  - **PostgreSQL**: An advanced relational database for storing user data securely.
  - **Firebase**: A comprehensive platform for building web and mobile applications with real-time data syncing.
  - **Tensorflow**: To Create the FER Model using FER2013 Dataset.

- **Architecture**: 
  - **Clean Architecture**: Ensures the application is modular and maintainable.
  - **SOLID Principles**: Follows best practices for software development, promoting scalability and ease of testing.

## Architecture
The *Mindful* app employs a clean architecture pattern, allowing for separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability. This design makes the app adaptable to future changes and ensures a robust user experience. By adhering to SOLID principles, *Mindful* promotes best practices that facilitate development and testing.

#### Key Architectural Decisions:
- **ModelView-ViewModel pattern** to handle user requests and business logic.
- **Separation of concerns** for better code management and maintainability.
- **Extensibility** built-in so new AI features and wellness tools can be integrated smoothly in future updates.

To run *Mindful* locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARYPROGRAMMER/mindful.git
   cd server/mental-health-api/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables (OPTIONAL, USE MINE)**:
  Changes in API_KEY (if needed) to be done in : 

   ```plaintext
   mental-health-api/
   ├──...          
   ├──...         
   ├──...          
   ├──...        
   ├── server.js          # Main server file
   ├── infrastructure/               
       ├── geminiai/   
       ├   └── geminiService.js  # NEW API KEY ADDING SLOT
       └──── db/    
              └── index.js  # PostGres Setup
   
   ```

4. **Run the Server**: (Not Needed after v1.0.6)
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
5. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   cd ../../lib/
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   
   ```
   Alternatively you could use :
   ```bash
   flutter build apk
   ```
5. **Structure of DB**:

    # Songs Table
    
        YOU NEED TO CREATE THIS YOURSELF IN POSTGRESQL (Not Needed after v1.0.6)
    
        This is the structure of the `songs` table in the `public` schema.
        
        | Column   | Type                   | Collation | Nullable | Default                                |
        |----------|------------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------------------------|
        | `title`  | `character varying(100)`|           | `false`  |                                        |
        | `author` | `character varying(100)`|           | `false`  |                                        |
        | `songlink`| `character varying(256)`|          | `false`  |                                        |
        | `id`     | `bigint`                |           | `false`  | `nextval('songs_id_seq'::regclass)`    |
        | `imageid`| `character varying(256)`|           | `true`   |                                        |
        
        ### Notes:
        - The `id` column is auto-incremented using the `nextval('songs_id_seq'::regclass)` function.
        - `imageid` is optional and can store a link or identifier for the image associated with the song.

6.  **PROVIDE CONNECTION IN FLUTTER** : (NOT NEEDED AFTER v1.0.6)
    
    ```bash
    cd lib/features/meditation/data/meditation_remote_source.dart
    cd lib/features/music/data/song_database.dart
    ```
    Give your IPv4 in the Uri.Parse url. ("mine starts with 192").
